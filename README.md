Public repository on witch you can find various source code and algorithms to learn the Rust programming lanaugage and the libraries.

Inside the various directories you can find a README and other Markdown files on witch all the functions and the concepts are explained

Make sure to use Rust 1.62.0 (released on 30/06/2022) or later versions, along with

    ```
    edition = "2021" 
    ```
    
in the Cargo.toml file of all projects to configure them to use Rust 2021 edition idioms.

The 2021 edition of the Rust Programming Language includes a number of improvements that make Rust more ergonomic and correct some inconsistencies.

The Rust 2021 edition is backwards compatible with the Rust 2018 edition, so all your existing Rust code will continue to compile with the Rust 2021 edition.
